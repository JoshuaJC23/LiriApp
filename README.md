# LiriApp

This application allows one to input information: a movie title, an artist(s), and a song.
The application will run the user input through axios to APIs and NPM packages; will gather
the information recieved and return it to the computer for the user to read.

This app can tell you if one has a concert and the information of where(venue), when, and time.
It also can tell you of a movie with its title, year it came out, imdb rating, rotten tomatoes rating,
the country where it was produced, the language, the plot of the movie, and the actors.
It also tells you the the artist(s) of a song, the song name, the album, and a link to a snippet of the song.

## Programming Tools

In this app we used npm packages for spotify, omdb, axios, package.json, and dotenv.
This allowed us to send the requests through axios in order to recieve the data
of the selected input.  This was done asynchronously.

## Snapshots of App

I also included an images file with images included to show that the app works and flow of it.
It shows examples of user input and the output in data.
